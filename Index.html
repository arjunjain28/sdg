				Waste management research now is the global and challenging issue of managing waste in a sustainable manner. It involves                                     studying waste generation,collection, treatment, recycling, and disposal methods. Researchers in waste management strive
                                to develop effective waste management strategies, technologies,and policies to minimize environmental impacts, promote                                       resource recovery,and reduce pollution. As concerns about waste generation, plastic pollution,and landfill capacity                                          increase, research in waste management becomes essential for developing more sustainable and circular waste management                                 systems.

                               In India Population is growing day by day , because of the lack of waste management rules.The dumps or wastage are                                           overflowing surrounding just about every city .Even I can say the people are not serious about environmental pollution . 
                               They throw everything in plastic,clothes , food wastage, chemical wastage , Electronic gadget wastages,factory garbage etc.
                               Because there is no serious penalty for this. Waste management rules in India are based on the principles of "sustainable                                development", "precautionary" and "polluter pays".
